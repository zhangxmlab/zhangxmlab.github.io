# Prospective Students

I am actively seeking highly motivated and dedicated students to join my lab. Prospective applicants should hold a Bachelor’s degree, preferably in fields such as geography, ecology, urban planning and design, landscape architecture, or related disciplines.

If any aspect of my current research portfolio or previous scholarly work resonates with your academic interests and career aspirations, I warmly invite you to get in touch. I welcome informal inquiries and exploratory conversations at any time—whether you are in the early stages of considering graduate studies or are preparing your application.

Joining our lab offers the opportunity to engage in meaningful, innovative research within a collaborative and supportive intellectual environment. I look forward to connecting with passionate individuals who are eager to contribute to our projects and develop their expertise.
