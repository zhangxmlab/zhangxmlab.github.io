Our research integrates landscape ecology, sustainability science, and geospatial analysis to address pressing challenges at the nexus of ecological security and global environmental change. The lab is dedicated to understanding the dynamics of social-ecological systems and developing strategic pathways for achieving ecological sustainability in the face of climate change and anthropogenic pressures.

<strong>Landscape Sustainability and Ecological Security Patterns</strong>  
This research stream focuses on identifying and safeguarding critical ecological patterns that underpin landscape sustainability and regional ecological security. By leveraging spatial modeling and remote sensing, the lab aims to map ecological networks, assess ecosystem health, and design conservation strategies that enhance ecosystem resilience against climate change and urban expansion.

<strong>Global Change Ecology and Telecoupling</strong>    
This theme investigates how global-scale phenomena—such as climate change, commodity trade, and species invasions—drive ecological changes in local and regional landscapes (telecoupling). The research develops frameworks to quantify the cross-boundary flows of ecosystem services and disservices, providing critical insights for equitable global governance and responsibility sharing.

<strong>Nature-Based Solutions for Climate Adaptation and Mitigation</strong>    
This line of inquiry explores the efficacy of nature-based solutions (NbS)—including ecological restoration, green infrastructure, and sustainable land management—as integrated strategies for climate change adaptation and mitigation. The research evaluates the co-benefits of NbS for carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation, and human well-being, with a focus on scalable implementation in vulnerable regions.
