Our research integrates landscape ecology, sustainability science, and geospatial analysis to address critical challenges at the intersection of ecological security and global environmental change. Our work is dedicated to advancing a mechanistic understanding of social-ecological system dynamics and formulating robust strategies for achieving ecological sustainability under the dual pressures of climate change and anthropogenic forcing.

<strong>Landscape Sustainability and Ecological Security</strong>  
This theme is centered on the identification and preservation of critical ecological patterns that constitute the foundation of landscape sustainability and regional ecological security. By employing cutting-edge spatial modeling and remote sensing technologies, we aim to characterize ecological networks, conduct rigorous assessments of ecosystem health, and pioneer conservation strategies designed to bolster ecosystem resilience against climate change and anthropogenic expansion.

<strong>Spatially Explicit Carbon Emissions and Mitigation</strong>  
This theme investigates the spatial patterns, drivers, and mitigation pathways of carbon emissions across multiple scales. We develop high-resolution emission inventories by integrating remote sensing data, energy statistics, and land-use information to pinpoint emission hotspots and trace their evolution. A key focus is on unraveling the socioeconomic and biophysical drivers behind emission trajectories, and evaluating the effectiveness of mitigation policies and low-carbon transitions, with a particular interest in the role of landscapes as carbon sinks.

<strong>Global Change Ecology and Telecoupling</strong>    
This theme interrogates the mechanisms by which global-scale phenomena (e.g., climate change, commodity trade, species invasions) precipitate ecological changes in local and regional landscapes through the telecoupling framework. We construct conceptual and analytical frameworks to quantify the transboundary flows of ecosystem services and disservices, thereby producing evidence critical for informing equitable global governance and fostering shared socio-ecological responsibility.

<strong>Nature-Based Solutions for Climate Adaptation and Mitigation</strong>    
This theme systematically examines the efficacy of nature-based solutions (NbS)—encompassing ecological restoration, green infrastructure, and sustainable land management—as synergistic strategies for climate change adaptation and mitigation. Our research evaluates the multifunctional co-benefits of NbS, including their roles in carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation, and human well-being, with a particular emphasis on developing scalable implementation models for vulnerable regions.
